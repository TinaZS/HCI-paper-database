## Project Overview

This is an HCI paper database application with a React frontend and Flask backend that uses FAISS vector search and Supabase for data storage. The system enables semantic search over academic papers, allows user to like and dislike papers, allows them to interact with a RAG chatbot, and with user authentication and session management.
